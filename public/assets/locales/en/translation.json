    "about_me": "For more than five years, I have been deeply interested in software development. This passion traces back to my childhood when my parents bought me my first computer. Since that moment, I was captivated by the multitude of things that could be done with it.\n\nAs I grew older, my interest in computer science, particularly programming, kept growing. Since then, I have dedicated a lot of time and effort to learning a lot about software development and programming.\n\nOn this journey, I have studied and experimented with various programming languages, from Java and Visual Basic to Python and JavaScript. I have also developed skills in database design, server management, and system integration.\n\nAs I gained experience, I realized that my interest in software development was not only limited to programming itself but also extended to enjoying teamwork, learning from other developers, and sharing my knowledge with them.",
