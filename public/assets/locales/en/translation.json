    "about_me": "For more than five years, I have been extremely passionate about software development. This passion dates back to my childhood when my parents bought me my first computer. From that moment on, I was captivated by the many things that could be done with a computer. \n\nAs I grew up, my interest in computer science and programming in particular increased. I have always been fascinated by the way software can solve problems and make people's lives easier. Since then, I have dedicated a lot of time and effort to learning everything I can about software development and programming. \n\nAlong this path, I have learned to program in several programming languages, from Java and Visual Basic to Python and JavaScript. I have also developed skills in database design, server management, and system integration. \n\nAs I gained experience, I realized that my passion for software development was not limited to programming alone, but I also enjoyed working in teams, learning from other developers, and sharing my knowledge with them. \n\nI hope to continue learning and growing in this career and to be able to contribute to the creation of innovative technological solutions that can improve people's lives.",
